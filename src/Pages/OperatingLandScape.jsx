        <p>India on track for future- ready railway system</p>
        <p>
        The Government of India is revolutionising India's railway infrastructure with projects such as expanding high-speed trains, redevelopment of stations and setting ambitious targets for freight transportation modal share. <br />
The Government has outlined
a visionary roadmap for India's infrastructure growth, particularly focusing on the transformation
of the Indian Railways over the next five years. The roadmap includes operationalising 4,500 Vande Bharat trains by 2047
and introducing 50 Amrit Bharat trains in the 2024-25 fiscal
year to enhance passenger experience. The plans also include manufacturing 1,000 new trains, which are capable of 250 kmph and implementing a H 4.2 lakh crore, 10-year scheme for multi- tracking on high-density lines to alleviate congestion.
        </p>
        <p><b>Our response</b></p>
        <p>Our primary focus has consistently been on the railway sector. We have diversified our product range to encompass a comprehensive supply of locomotives for this industry. Our objective is to substantially enhance our revenue contribution from Indian railways</p>

        <p className='light-blue-text'>Growing demand for data centres</p>
        <p>In the digital era, India's telecommunications sector is essential for communication, data transmission, and emerging technologies such as 5G. Growth in this sector is fuelled by rising data centre projects, telecom expansion and infrastructure development. Data centres need a reliable power supply, boosting demand for diesel generators (DG sets). Similarly, the rapid expansion of telecom networks across the country increases the need for DG sets to ensure continuous connectivity.
