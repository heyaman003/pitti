      <p className="bold-p-xl-c">Dear Shareholders,</p>
      <p className="bold-p-xl">
        At the outset, we would like to thank all of you, our valued customers
        and stakeholders, for your continued support. Before we dive into our
        performance for the fiscal year, it is worthwhile to first consider the
        macro- economic landscape in the year gone by.
      </p>
      <p>
        The global operating environment continued to be uncertain during the
        year, with sticky inflation and persistent geopolitical conflicts.
        However, the global economy has been surprisingly resilient, despite
        major Central Banks increasing interest rates to curb inflationary
        pressure. India continued to be a bright spot on the global economic
        landscape, registering 8.2% growth in real terms and the Central
        Government reduced the fiscal deficit by a considerable margin. <br />
        According to the Economic Survey for 2023- 24, the Indian economy has
        broadly caught up with pre-COVID growth trends and is likely to grow by
        6.5% to 7% in 2024, with prospects of registering 7%-plus growth in the
        coming years. <br />
        For us, consistently adapting to customer needs, creating niches and
        accelerating growth have always been part of our DNA. We will continue
        to embrace this philosophy as we go forward. We focused on making
        margin-accretive value-added products. This has led us to transition
        from being a lamination-led company to a multi-product offering
        business. Powered by vertically integrated manufacturing, a portfolio of
        products catering to diverse end-user industries, steady cashflow,
        strong relationships with clients and business partners, we have
        delivered an impressive 3-year Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
        across various financial and operational metrics. <br />
        Despite transient challenges in FY24, we at Pitti Engineering are
        jubilant to have crossed new milestones. We also registered significant
        growth in sales volumes, EBITDA and net profit. Our sales volume for the
        year surged by 16.55% to 42,305 metric tonnes, total revenue grew by
        11.79%, reaching H 1,249.81 crore, EBITDA rose by 17.39% to H 177.72
        crore, net profit increased by 53.32%, to H 90.20 crore and cash
        accruals improved by 39.38% to H 144.22 crore. Our blended EBITDA per
        metric tonne stands at H 42,008 per metric ton. During the year, we
        incurred a capex of H 209.37 crore. <br />
        Moving on to our operational highlights, during the year gone by, we
        developed major value-added products for our global clientele. We
        successfully delivered fully finished stator frames along with
        lamination cores, ready for winding into traction motors, for
        prestigious customers. By integrating casting, forging and lamination
        facilities, we created value-added products that enabled our customers
        to optimise their ground-level manufacturing activities through enhanced
        cost efficiency.
        <br />
        In alignment with the government's 'Make in India' strategy, we
        contributed to the ramping up of Vande Bharat trains by developing
        value-added products for a total of 18 projects.
        <br />
        On the global front, we delivered critical components, including wheel
        hubs, support seals and more, for overseas OHV mining customers. These
        products required the integration of technical expertise in areas like
        critical fabrication, forging, heat treatment, machining and so on, made
        possible through the strength of our business model and organisational
        competencies.
        <br />
        Further, we assisted the Indian railways by enhancing the supply of 6FRA
        products to traction motor manufacturers.
        <br />
        We have significantly bolstered the wind power generation sector by
        providing comprehensive support for projects up to 5 MW, supplying
        top-tier products to renowned international clients. <br />
        Additionally, we developed and supplied critical parts for electrolysers
        used in green hydrogen production to one of our overseas customer.{" "}
        <br />
        By consistently supplying fully finished stator assembly cores, duly
        machined and ready for winding (RFW), for mini hydro plants, we
        contributed to a clean and renewable energy source globally. <br />
        Last but not least, we developed products for marine applications, such
        as electric power propulsion systems, which replace thermal combustion
        engines and help reduce global warming. <br />
        Going forward, we anticipate continued growth in the demand for our
        products and services. In line with this, we have acquired Bagadia
        Chaitra Industries Private Limited and are in the process of
        commissioning expanded capacities in the Aurangabad facility. These
        initiatives will increase our consolidated capacity from 56,000 TPA to
        90,000 TPA, further strengthening our position as India's largest
        manufacturer of laminations. Additionally, this acquisition provides us
        with a strategically important manufacturing base in Bengaluru. With its
        proximity to other large consumption centres such as Coimbatore, Chennai
        and Hubli, it significantly improves customer serviceability in these
        regions. <br />
        We are particularly optimistic about the growth prospects of our
        machined component vertical. The input materials required for this are
        high-quality castings and customers impose stringent clauses on the
        sourcing of such castings. To facilitate the same and eliminate as many
        related- party transactions as possible, we decided to merge the
        promoter-owned casting business, Pitti Castings Private Limited, with
        Pitti Engineering Limited. This merged entity will bring in marquee
        clients as well as boost the development of machined castings for
        existing clients. <br />
        Upon the commissioning of new capacity at the Aurangabad facility, we
        will begin decommissioning the lamination capacity in Hyderabad. The
        vacated space will be repurposed to house increased machining capacity.
        We also have plans to reorganise our consolidated business to derive
        material synergies and reduce logistics costs. <br />
        We are committed to making our operations cleaner and greener. As part
        of this endeavour, we have undertaken a plantation project which will be
        spread across eight acres of land for planting ~36,500 trees at our
        manufacturing facilities. We are also working to substantially raise the
        contribution of renewable energy to our fuel mix as an endeavour for
        transition to net zero in the future years.
        <br />
        We are confident that these initiatives will pave the way for sustained
        success, driving impressive growth in both sales and profits and
        ultimately benefiting all our valued customers and stakeholders.
